- finish array integration
	1) creating a board; cell spawn, filling the array
	2) remove 'dead' gui cells or make them default to blank
	3) pool?
	4) eventually tie to cur.board (prob)

- Mouse capture; convert to g(ui)cell Coords
	1) creating gcells
		+ link with input queue
	2) Check if an array of dead cells would be better than dynamically adding/removing cells

- Think about reworking stepping in the FXMLController
	1) probably separate it from cell changes in 'input' queue

- Threads
	1) sleep
	2) divide the work

- make cells/buttons always rectangular (resize).

- Finish the thing.
